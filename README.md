# SalvageModel

Repository to fit the bayesian mortality model taking into account salvage logging. Go to https://www.overleaf.com/project/61d5583436dde4fa2f5cec66 for a presentation of the model. 

Package ```targets``` is needed to run the script. Once ```targets``` is loaded, just run ```tar_make()``` from R and the script will download the packages and data needed, and run the analyses.

# SalvageModel

R script to fit the bayesian mortality model for the paper *Functional traits and climate drive interspecific differences in disturbance-induced tree mortality* by Julien Barrere, Bj√∂rn Reineking, Thomas Cordonnier, Niko Kulha, Juha Honkaniemi, Kari T. Korhonen, Mikko Peltoniemi, Paloma Ruiz-Benito, Miguel A. Zavala and Georges Kunstler

From NFI data from Spain, France and Finland, the script exports the model outputs as rdata file. As Finnish data are not publicly available, the script can not be run by any user. The rdata generated by the script are stored in Zenedo, and can be used to reproduce the paper analyses via the following [script](https://github.com/jbarrere3/DisturbancePaper). 

For any question about the script or analyses, contact Julien BARRERE (julien.barrere@inrae.fr).
